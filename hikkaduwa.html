<!--Sum information about Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery-->
<section>
  <p>Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is one of the most popular and unique tourist attractions in Sri Lanka. It is located in the beautiful coastal town of Hikkaduwa, which is known for its pristine sandy beaches, crystal-clear waters, and rich marine life. The hatchery was established in 1996 with the primary objective of protecting and conserving the five species of sea turtles found in Sri Lanka, namely, the Olive Ridley, Green Turtle, Hawksbill, Loggerhead, and Leatherback.
  </p>
  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>What makes the Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery special is the fact that it gives travelers the opportunity to experience the conservation efforts up close. Visitors are taken on a tour of the hatchery, which typically lasts for about an hour. During the tour, they get to see the newly hatched baby turtles, learn about their life cycles, and witness how the hatchery staff works tirelessly to protect them.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>The hatchery plays a crucial role in preserving Sri Lanka's sea turtle population. It is estimated that the number of sea turtles around the world has declined significantly over the past few decades due to various factors, such as pollution, climate change, and beach erosion. Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is doing its part to reverse this trend by protecting the eggs and newly hatched turtles, providing them with a safe environment to grow and then releasing them back into the ocean.
