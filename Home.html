        <h1>Welcome to the Turtle Hatchery in Sri Lanka</h1>
        <div class="intor-par">
          <p class="intro para">We are excited to present our brand new website, which showcases the beauty of Sri Lankan turtle hatcheries. Here you can learn more about different species of turtles that thrive in this region and find detailed data regarding their protection statuses. And if you're looking for a way to make an impact, we'll share strategies on how individuals can play a role in bolstering crucial conservation work across these sites. Our ultimate aim for launching this platform is rooted in inspiring more people to donate generously toward these important causes!</p>
          <br>
          <p class="intro para">Sri Lanka is a magnificent country that stands out in the huge Indian Ocean. It is renowned for its amazing biodiversity, which includes some extraordinary marine life forms. Five out of the seven species of marine turtles find refuge within their aquatic domain, making their diverse population of vibrant sea turtles an integral part of them. In order to keep these fascinating species living as a part of our natural history, humans must now take urgent action to conserve and maintain this essential habitat.</p>

        <h1>Turtle Hatchery</h1>
        <div class="hatchery-par">
          <p class="sub-par">Sea turtle hatcheries are important because they collect eggs from beaches at risk, safeguard them from potential threats such as predators, closely monitor their development stages and only release hatchlings once it's safe for them in water. What's more interesting about this place is its advocacy for preserving sea turtles while educating individuals about proper treatment towards these fascinating marine creatures.</p>

          <h2>Leatherback Turtle</h2>
          <img src="Image/Leatherback_Sea_Turtle.png" alt="Leatherback Sea Turtle">
          <div class="content">
            <p>Leatherback sea turtles are the largest marine animals in the world and can grow to 2 meters long. Their diving capabilities are equally impressive, as they can plunge into depths reaching nearly half that length (1200m). The magnificent creatures are threatened by pollution, poaching and trafficking of their eggs.</p>
            <p>The leatherback turtle has a distinct characteristic of having a core body temperature that is higher than surrounding water. This feature allows it to gain an evolutionary advantage in colder seas and also provides protection from natural predators like sharks and orcas. With its larger size, the leatherback turtle can better defend itself against these enemies.</p>

          <h2>Olive Ridley Turtle</h2>
          <img src="Image/D21.jpeg" alt="Olive ridley turtle">
          <div class="content">
            <p>Olive ridley turtles are the most abundant sea turtle in the world, with an estimated population of over 5 million. Their carapace is heart-shaped and highly serrated along the edges. The species is known for its synchronized nesting behavior, where thousands of females come ashore at the same time to lay their eggs.</p>
            <p>The Olive ridley turtle, which has a population of 5 million individuals, is a beloved sight at beaches across the globe. The animal's shell--with a distinctive heart-shaped pattern encircled by sharp serrations--is covered in dung, which the turtle uses as camouflage when it hides from predators. Surprisingly, this species exhibits fascinating reproductive behavior in which thousands of females come ashore all at once to lay their eggs.</p>

          <h2>Hawksbill Turtle</h2>
          <img src="Image/Hnow.jpeg" alt="Hawksbill Turrtle">
          <div class="content">
            <p>The hawksbill turtle is struggling to survive as demand for its shell, which is used in manufacturing ornaments and jewelry, grows. The turtles boast prominent features such as a curved beak and scutes that overlap on their shells, which serve as an easy identifier.</p>
            <p>Hawksbill turtles are important in the ecosystem because their feeding habits help keep harmful sponges out of coral reefs. It is devastating to hear that their numbers have plummeted by more than 80% over the last few decades.</p>
