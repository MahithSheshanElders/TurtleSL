    <u>Our History
    </u>
  </h2>
  <br>
<br>
<p>Sri Lankan travelers should not miss visiting the Bentota Turtle Hatchery if they have an appreciation for wildlife preservation initiatives. Launched by Mr. Rohan de Silva in 1981, this substantial undertaking aims to secure the safety of endangered sea turtles frequently seen near the Bentota coastal regions. 
  The project team gathers eggs from beaches and carefully moves them to a controlled environment for hatching under safe supervision procedures. 
  
  Attendees at the facility can watch baby turtles as they progress toward being reunited with their original habitat under the careful guidance of caregivers. 
  
  
  Thanks to such conservation programs, Sri Lanka has become home to several more sites like this one, highlighting the importance of raising awareness about wildlife preservation. The government support these initiatives giving us more reason to visit and learn about these compelling creatures.</p>

    <u>Turtle Conservation Programs
    </u>
  </h2>
  <br>
<br>
<p>The commendable initiative taken by Bentota's turtle conservation program strives for protecting turtles' lives within their natural habitat successfully. The primary focus of this project is rescuing sick or injured sea turtles, nurturing them until they regain full strength before releasing them back into their home- oceans! Additionally, through education programs, visitors get educated on why maintaining our marine ecosystem's integrity is essential for everyone's welfare, including these magnificent sea creatures' wellbeing. 
  While visiting Bentota for tourism purposes offers an exceptional opportunity for tourists who want an insight into nature life's intricacies; we nonetheless highly recommend immersing oneself entirely through participation in this program. 
  
  It would not only support the conservation of turtles but also provide visitors with an experience of a lifetime.</p>

    <p>Located at Sri Lanka's southern shore, Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery has dedicated its effort towards protecting both turtles and their eggs against environmental dangers while concurrently emphasizing conservation practices hoping to reach more individuals across different areas. Eggs gathered nearby undergo incubation in controlled environments before being released into oceans after hatching, ensuring a higher survival rate for baby turtles' first stage of life cycle. Besides housing disabled or wounded turtles unable to endure natural circumstances through proper treatment, this hatchery also provides an opportunity for viewers' exposure by presenting distinct turtle species exhibits regularly held within its premises- all financed solely through donations or volunteers’ contributions.</p>
