    <u>Our History
    </u>
  </h2>
  <br>
<br>
<p>The origins of the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery can be traced back to 1981 when like minded Sri Lankan wildlife enthusiasts and researchers joined forces to establish an organization aimed at protecting sea turtles in their natural habitat. This non profit venture seeks to increase their population while also safeguarding against threats arising from hunting, fishing development activities as well as beach erosion that destroys turtle nesting sites. During the 1970s many fishermen along Sri Lankas coast relied on traditional fishing techniques that inadvertently captured and killed these marine creatures for their valuable meat and shells. To counter such trends activists established this initiative as a safe haven for sea turtles where they could nest without fear while also rescuing injured or orphaned ones through dedicated care until they could be released into the ocean once again.</p>

    <u>Turtle Conservation Programs
    </u>
  </h2>
  <br>
<br>
<p>Located in Kosgoda - a coastal village in Sri Lanka - is the Kosgoda Turtle Conservation Program established back in 1981 solely for conserving endangered sea turtles that inhabit this region. Concentrating specifically on five native species- green turtle, hawksbill turtle; loggerhead turtle; leatherback turtle; olive ridley turtle- this program operates under Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society collaborating closely with local communities including schools as well as government organizations for more effective action towards conserving these creatures. 
  Various objectives aim at making this possible- from carrying out significant researches to direct conservation efforts down to motivational education programs empowering people about protecting these wonderful beings' existence when it comes to specific operations; they have a heart: The Turtles Hatchery where they collect eggs from beaches allowing hatching under controlled circumstances while releasing hatchlings back into the sea. The goal is to increase survival rates as only one in 5000 manages to make it through to adulthood. Also, the program conducts researches on these turtles' lifestyle habits such as reproduction, migration patterns, feeding habits and growth rates. The data collected plays an important role in enhancing conservation measures.</p>
